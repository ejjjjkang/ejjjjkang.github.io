            Challenges, and Design Opportunities in Algorithmic Platforms",
		abs: "In many creator economy platforms, algorithms significantly impact creatorsâ€™ practices and decisions about their creative expression and monetization. Emerging research suggests that the opacity of the algorithm and platform policies often distract creators from their creative endeavors. To study how algorithmic platforms can be more â€˜creator-friendly,â€™ we conducted a mixed-methods study: interviews (N=14) and a participatory design workshop (N=12) with YouTube creators. \
		Through the interviews, we found how creatorsâ€™ folk theories of the curation algorithm impact their work strategies â€” whether they choose to work with or against the algorithm â€” and the associated challenges in the process. In the workshop, creators explored solution ideas to overcome the aforementioned challenges, such as fostering diverse and creative expressions, achieving success as a creator, and motivating creators to continue their job. Based on these findings, we discuss design opportunities for how algorithmic platforms can support and motivate creators to sustain their creative work.",

			"When AI Meets the K-Pop culture: A case study of fans' perception of AI Private Call",
		img: "/thumbnails/fanAI01.jpeg",
		abs: "In this position paper, we investigate K-Pop fansâ€™ perception of AI synthesized\
voices imitating their favorite idolsâ€™ voices. Using â€˜AI Private Callâ€™ as a case study,\
in which fans listen to an idolâ€™s voice messages created by AI voice technology, we\
interviewed 15 real users who have experienced the service. Results show that the\
use of AI voices and the mechanics of the service conflicted with the fan culture\
where idolsâ€™ contributions and social presence are highly valued. Moreover, fans\
were worried about the potential online harassment towards idols, which may be\
caused by usersâ€™ inappropriate use, and data infringement of idols. Based on our\
findings, we discuss how the application of AI affects fan cultures, and how AI can\
be potentially designed for bridging the fan-idol relationship.",
